# Jotto-Bot

Jotto is a game similar to Wordle where players take turns guessing five letter words to match their opponents secret word of their choosing. When a letter matches in both the guess word and the secret word the opponent tells the player how many of these letters there are in both words.
This project aims to create a discord bot that can start a Jotto game between two players or against a computer and also providing a cheat sheet which is commonly used in Jotto to keep track of the game.
